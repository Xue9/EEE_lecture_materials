# Lecture slides for Electrical Engineering at XJTLU
Hey, if you are looking for lecture slides from Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), you've come to the right place. All the lecture materials from Year 2 to Year 3 and some of the optional modules are included. Also, some experiment handbooks are included as well. However, because each file cannot have size larger than 50MB, so some ebooks were not included here.

Some of the materials might be <b>out-of-date</b>, because every module leader prefers to create his (or her) own materials when taking over the module. So, these slides could be used as references. <b>Please stick to your own module leaders' arrangement. </b>

I myself do not hold any copyright for all of these slides. The copyrights still belong to our kind and generous professors and lecturers :)

You can directly click the module names that are in <font color="blue">blue</font> to download the zip files for each module, but this is not applicable for some modules which has size larger than 20MB. Moreover, if you want to download all of these slides in <b>China</b>, you'd better use <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1aE411p7Cd">gitee</a>, because the total size is about 2.3GB which could take you a centry to download or clone.

By the way, if you are a Year-four student and you are currently applying to master programs, you could check my application timeline and my results on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/318624725/answer/920863161).
