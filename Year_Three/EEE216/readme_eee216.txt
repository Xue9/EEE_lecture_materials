Techically speaking, there is no lecture slide for this module, because they were not uploaded to ICE when Dr. Anthony Centeno. Although there was not pre-class reading material, there were recorded lecture vidoes uploaded onto ICE. However, since Dr. Centeno has went to Glasgow in 2020, I really have no idea what will be the situation in the future. I am really sorry about this.
